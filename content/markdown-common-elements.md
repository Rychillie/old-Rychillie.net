## Basic formatting

This note **demonstrates** some of what [Markdown][1] is _capable of doing_.

And that's how to do it.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character. But we are using just 4 of them.

## Paragraph modifiers

### Quote

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.

## URLs

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

- A named link to [Mark It Down][3].
- Another named link to [Mark It Down](https://google.com/)
- Sometimes you just want a URL like <https://google.com/>.

## Horizontal rule

A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.
It's sometimes handy for breaking things up.

## Images

Markdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.

_Figure Caption_?

![Markdowm Image][/image/url]

![Markdowm Image][5]

<figcaption class="caption">Photo by John Doe</figcaption>

_Bigger Images_?

![Markdowm Image][5]{: class="bigger-image" }
